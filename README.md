# Digital-School-Groups
A platform created using ASP.NET by a team of 2 students of the The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest that allows users to register and participate in various courses.

## Features 
- there are 4 types of users: unregistered visitor, registered user,
moderator and administrator. 
- any user can search for groups in the platform  and can view
information about that group. Groups are divided into
categories: music, hobbies, culture, etc. (created dynamically), existing
possibility to add to new categories (admin can make Create Read Update Delete operations on
categories). 
- registered users can create new groups or join other groups. The user who created a group becomes the group moderator by default
respectively (which means he can delete the group if he wants). 
- the group moderator can accept new members or revoke members
who have inappropriate behavior.
- members of a group can add messages and add new activities in the
group calendar. They can also delete and edit their own messages. 
- members of a group can be viewed in a separate list. 
- a registered user can be part of several groups. So
the user has a list of the groups he belongs to. 
- the administrator takes care of the good functioning of the platform. It can
delete inappropriate content, messages, etc. or may revoke or
activate the rights of users and publishers.
